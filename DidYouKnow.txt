If the OCTGN server ever goes down and you cannot login, you can still play games "offline" via direct IP connection.

People can observe games.

Observers need to join the game's lobby before you start.

Once the table has loaded, those players should not load a deck or use the "Set Up" function. 

Observers are ignored by the game. However any player who wants can make their hand and deck visible to them and they can even peek at all cards in the table.

You can add more "Did you know"

Just contact the developer and give him your suggestions

The chat area has important messages

Almost anything important that happens in the game is announced there. 

Keep an eye on it, in case your opponent does a mistake.
