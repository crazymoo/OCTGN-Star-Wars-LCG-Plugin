People can observe games.

Observers need to join the game's lobby before you start.

Once the table has loaded, those players should not load a deck or use the "Set Up" function. 

Observers are ignored by the game. However any player who wants can make their hand and deck visible to them and they can even peek at all cards in the table.

::Important::: Observers need to stay in the game for the whole length. Leaving the game might break the scripts.

If an observer needs to leave, ask them to simply minimize OCTGN until the game is finished

The Developer of this plugin provides a voice chat server.

We provide a Mumble server to allow ANR players to be able to effortlessly connect and voice communicate with others.

Voice communication not only improves the speed of the game significantly, but it also makes it actually _feel_ like a boardgame, of which an important aspect if the player interaction outside of the game rules.

Even if you don't own a mic, take the time to install the mumble client and setup a connection to the server, so that you can connect easily. Even with one side being able to talk, it helps.

You should not discard cards by manually dragging them to your discard pile.

Rather user the "Discard Card/Thwart Objective" (shortcut is the key "del") function.

Doing so will trigger all the relevant scripts for this and any other card on the table (for example Leia's ability)
It will also discard any attachments of the card and clear all necessary variables.

Discarding cards manually is going to leave those variables unset, which will lead to game errors.
